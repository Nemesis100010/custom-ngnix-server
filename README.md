# 🔥 Custom Node.js Static File Server

A minimal static file server built **from scratch** using Node.js core modules (`http`, `fs`, `path`).  
No frameworks. No external dependencies. Just pure Node.js power. 🚀

## 📂 Features

- Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, Images)
- Dynamically detects and sets correct `Content-Type`
- Handles missing files with custom 404 message
- Clean and simple codebase — beginner-friendly

## 🧠 Learnings

This project helped me understand:
- How a basic HTTP server works in Node.js
- How to serve static assets
- File handling with `fs`
- MIME types and response headers
